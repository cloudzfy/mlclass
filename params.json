This course was given by Professor Ng. He gave me the background knowledge of machine learning. After this course, I realize the importance of linear algebra. From now, I will start to review and knowledge from my university lecture and find something interesting to learn. Hope you can have the similar harvest. Good luck!\r\n\r\n### Exercise List\r\n * Linear Regression\r\n * Logistic Regression\r\n * Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks\r\n * Neural Network Learning\r\n * Regularized Linear Regression and Bias/Variance\r\n * Support Vector Machines\r\n * K-Means Clustering and PCA\r\n * Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems\r\n\r\n### About Author\r\nThis project is designed by @cloudzfy as a self-study record.
