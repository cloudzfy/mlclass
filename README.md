### Overview
I took the Stanford Machine Learning course via Coursera.org, and gained a lot from it. This course was given by Professor Ng. He gave me the background knowledge of machine learning. After this course, I realize the importance of linear algebra. From now, I will start to review and knowledge from my university lecture and find something interesting to learn. Hope you can have the similar harvest. Good luck!
